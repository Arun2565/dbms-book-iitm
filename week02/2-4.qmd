This section will cover all the remaining basic operations.


## Cartesian Product 

The Cartesian Product is a combination of all the tuples that the Instructor and the Teacher has.
In this operation we are trying to relate the information on both the tables.
Ex : We can get the list of  courses an instructor is teaching, which is neither available in both the tables, but from the combination.


## Rename AS Operation

This is used when we need to change the name of an attribute or a relation. <br>
The problems that will occur are : 
1. we are trying to do instructor cross instructor, but before we were doing with different tables.
2. If we want to do an operation within an instance / table , it is difficult to clearly mention the table as both have same names.

<br>

So, we can just rename the tables using "AS" key. In the below  code, we are doing cartesian product within itself.

```
select  distinct  T.name 
from instructor as T, instructor as S,
where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept_name = 'Comp_Sci'

```

This code is used to compare the salary of the instructors whose salary is greater than salary of the instructors in the Computer Science.

## String Operations 

In some cases, there are some strings that we know partially and we want to find and look for that string. For this we have a `LIKE` operator. %% is used to do string matching.

```
select name
from instructor 
where name like '%dar%'
```
Ex : dar, sardar , majumdar will match for %dar 

- We can specify all the # of characters using underscore. 
Ex : %dar_ _ _  , this specifies the number of characters after the string.

- When it comes to string matching it is case sensitive.

- Also, SQL supports various operations like concatenation, converting from upper case to lower case, finding string length, extracting substrings, etc.

## Ordering the Tuples

In SQL when query results are displayed they are displayed in a lexical order. We use the clause `order by`     

```
select distinct name
from instructor
order by name
```

By default the `order by` is used to display the result in ascending order in default.
We can also sort using multiple attributes.

### Selecting Number of Tuples in Output

The `select top` is used to make it easier to view the tables and convenient.

```
select top 10 distinct name 
from instructor

```

- Different SQL Servers use different conventions for the SELECT TOP Clause.
    - SQL Server & MS Access supports `select top`
    - MySQL supports the limit clause.
    - Oracle uses the `fetch first n rows only` and `rownum`


### WHERE Clause Predicates 

SQL includes a `between` comparison operator. This can be used when there is a range to compare.

```
select name
from instructor
where salary between 90000 and 100000
```
- Tuple comparison 

```
select name, course_id
from instructor , teaches 
where (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, 'Biology');

```
## In Operator 

The `in` operator is used to simplify the predicate in the `where` clause. It is used to specify multiple values to be compared like in set membership.

```
select name 
from instructor
where dept_name in ('Comp. Sci','Biology')
```

## Duplicates

NOTE : In relational algebra no duplicates are allowed, in SQL duplicates are allowed.

Multi-set : We can have multiple elements which are identical and therefore, we can multiset operations.
