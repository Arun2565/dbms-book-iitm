If we want to do an operation within an instance / table , it is difficult to clearly mention the table as both have same names.\n\n<br>\n\nSo, we can just rename the tables using \"AS\" key.

We use the clause `order by`     \n\n```\nselect distinct name\nfrom instructor\norder by name\n```\n\nBy default the `order by` is used to display the result in ascending order in default.\nWe can also sort using multiple attributes.\n\n### Selecting Number of Tuples in Output\n\nThe `select top` is used to make it easier to view the tables and convenient.\n\n```\nselect top 10 distinct name \nfrom instructor\n\n```\n\n- Different SQL Servers use different conventions for the SELECT TOP Clause.\n    - SQL Server & MS Access supports `select top`\n    - MySQL supports the limit clause.\n    - Oracle uses the `fetch first n rows only` and `rownum`\n\n\n### WHERE Clause Predicates \n\nSQL includes a `between` comparison operator. This can be used when there is a range to compare.\n\n```\nselect name\nfrom instructor\nwhere salary between 90000 and 100000\n```\n- Tuple comparison \n\n```\nselect name, course_id\nfrom instructor , teaches \nwhere (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, 'Biology');\n\n```\n## In Operator \n\nThe `in` operator is used to simplify the predicate in the `where` clause. It is used to specify multiple values to be compared like in set membership.\n\n```\nselect name \nfrom instructor\nwhere dept_name in ('Comp. Sci','Biology')\n```\n\n## Duplicates\n\nNOTE : In relational algebra no duplicates are allowed, in SQL duplicates are allowed.\n\nMulti-set : We can have multiple elements which are identical and therefore, we can multiset operations.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis section will cover all the remaining basic operations.\n\n\n## Cartesian Product \n\nThe Cartesian Product is a combination of all the tuples that the Instructor and the Teacher has.\nIn this operation we are trying to relate the information on both the tables.\nEx : We can get the list of  courses an instructor is teaching, which is neither available in both the tables, but from the combination.\n\n\n## Rename AS Operation\n\nThis is used when we need to change the name of an attribute or a relation. <br>\nThe problems that will occur are : \n1. we are trying to do instructor cross instructor, but before we were doing with different tables.\n2.
